Instructions:

Have a Launchpad Account, have your SSH key uploaded.

Build your Ubuntu 10.04 VM.

Add your SSH key to your user - ~/.ssh/id_dsa or ~/.ssh/id_rsa

As your user, do:

curl http://c0020195.cdn1.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/install-swift.sh > install-swift.sh
bash ./install-swift.sh

You'll be prompted for your username, your group (which is most likely just
your username again), your Launchpad login, and the email address you want any
bzr commits to use.

When the script completes, it will prompt you to run the commands needed to
execute the funtional test suite.
